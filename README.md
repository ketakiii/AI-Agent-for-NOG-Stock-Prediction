# Northern Oil and Gas (NOG) Stock Prediction 

An end-to-end time series forecasting pipeline that predicts the stock price of Northern Oil & Gas (NOG) using 13+ years of historical market and macroeconomic data. The project intergrates statistical, machine learning and deep learning models, data pipelines, model monitoring and visualizations.

## Why Analyse Northern Oil & Gas (NOG)?
NOG is a key player in in the US oil industry, specializing in non-operating interests in high-quality oil & gas assets. There a multiple compelling reasons for analyzing this stock:

- **High Sensitivity to Macroeconomic Trends**: NOG's stock is closely tied to crude oil prices, interest rates, and global energy demandâ€”making it ideal for studying the interplay between commodity markets and equities.
- **Energy Sector Volatility**: The energy sector is inherently cyclical and volatile, offering rich patterns for time series modeling and anomaly detection.
- **Market Relevance**: As a mid-cap stock in a critical sector, NOG is a useful proxy for understanding broader market behavior in energy and commodities.
- **Actionable Use Case**: Forecasting NOG prices has real-world use cases in portfolio allocation, algorithmic trading strategies, and hedging oil price exposure.
